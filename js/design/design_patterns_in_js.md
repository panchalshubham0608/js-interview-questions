# Design Patterns in JavaScript
This doc serves the purpose of summary notes from the Udemy course [Design Patterns in JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-javascript/)  


**What are design patterns?**  
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.  


### SOLID PRINCIPLES
**What are SOLID principles?**  
In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.  
1. _**S**ingle Responsibility Principle_: A class should have only one reason to change meaning that it should have only one responsibility.
2. _**O**pen-Closed Principle_: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. _**L**iskov Substitution Principle_: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
4. _**I**nterface Segregation Principle_: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. 
5. _**D**ependency Inversion Principle_: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
