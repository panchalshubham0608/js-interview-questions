# LLD (Low Level Design)
LLD focuses on designing each component in detail such as what classes are needed, what abstractions to use, how object creation should happen, how data flows between different objects, etc.  
With LLD in place building software & writing code becomes easy!  

Here are a few examples of LLD:
- [Snake and Ladder LLD](https://www.interviewbit.com/low-level-design-interview-questions/#how-to-design-snake-and-ladder-lld)
- [Parking lot](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-parking-lot-using-object-oriented-principles/)
