# What are object prototype?
- Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. 
- Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype
- When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property
